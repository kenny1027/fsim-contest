# Fault Simulation Contest Template

This repository contains a basic project setup for the fault simulator implementation contest.

Clone this repo and install the requirements:
```
git clone https://github.com/s-holst/fsim-contest.git
cd fsim-contest
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the three included scripts in order to download the circuits, generate tests and run a fake fault simulation (just loading the data).

This code uses [kyupy](https://github.com/s-holst/kyupy), a Python library for handling and simulating gate-level circuits.

Feel free to fork this and add your code to `3_stuck_at_fault_simulator.py`.

Good luck!
